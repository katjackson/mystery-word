## Mystery Word

Mystery word runs in three modes(Easy, Normal, Hard). It selects a random word from a dictionary file (/usr/share/dict/words) that is 4 - 6 (Easy), 6 - 8 (Normal) or 8+ (Hard) characters long.

The player guesses one letter at a time until they correctly guess the word or make 8 incorrect guesses.

Player is given the choice to play or exit at the beginning of the main function.

mystery_word_test does not test funtions that ask for user input.

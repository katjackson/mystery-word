## Mystery Word

Mystery Word runs in three modes(Easy, Normal, Hard). It selects a random word from a dictionary file (/usr/share/dict/words) that is 4 - 6 (Easy), 6 - 8 (Normal) or 8+ (Hard) characters long.

The player guesses one letter at a time until they correctly guess the word or make 8 incorrect guesses.

Player is given the choice to play or exit at the beginning of the main function.

## Evil Mystery Word

The Evil Mystery Word game starts with a list of words of the same length, based on the chosen difficulty. The computer narrows down the list of words as the player guesses, in order to evade a correct guess.

Player is given 15 guesses.

Functions that ask for user input are not tested.
